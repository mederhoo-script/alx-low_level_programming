# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the projects and tasks in the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" curriculum at Holberton School. Each subdirectory represents a different project, and within each project directory, you can find the specific task files and their solutions.

The purpose of this project is to further enhance understanding and proficiency in using functions and nested loops in the C programming language. It covers various topics such as nested loops, function prototypes, function parameters, variable scoping, and more.

## Project List

1. **0-positive_or_negative**: A program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. **1-last_digit**: A program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
3. **2-print_alphabet**: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.
4. **3-islower**: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
5. **4-isalpha**: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
6. **5-sign**: A function that prints the sign of a number.
7. **6-abs**: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. **7-print_last_digit**: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. **8-24_hours**: A function that prints every minute of the day in the format "HH:MM".
10. **9-times_table**: A function that prints the 9 times table.
11. **10-add**: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. **11-print_to_98**: A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.
13. **12-times_table**: A function that prints the n times table.
14. **13-print_comb**: A program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.
15. **100-numbers**: A program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with certain conditions.
16. **101-print_number**: A function that prints an integer using only the putchar function.

## Usage
To compile the C files, use the following command format:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```
Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile, and `<output_file>` with the desired name for the compiled output file.

To execute the compiled program, use the following command:
```
./<output_file>
```
Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the compiled output file.
