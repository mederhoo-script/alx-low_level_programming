# 0x14-bit_manipulation README

## Overview

This repository contains C functions related to bit manipulation. The provided prototypes and descriptions are as follows:

## Prototypes:

```c
#ifndef __MAIN_H__
#define __MAIN_H__

/* Convert a binary string to an unsigned integer */
unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

/* Print the binary representation of an unsigned long int */
void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

/* Write a character to the standard output */
int _putchar(char c);

/* Get the value of a bit at a specific index */
int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

/* Set a bit at a specific index to 1 */
int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

/* Set a bit at a specific index to 0 */
int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

/* Calculate the number of bits needed to flip to transform n to m */
unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);

/* Check the endianness of the system */
int get_endianness(void);

#endif
```

## Function Descriptions:

1. `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)`: This function converts a binary string `b` to an unsigned integer.

2. `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)`: Print the binary representation of an unsigned long int `n`.

3. `int _putchar(char c)`: This function writes a character `c` to the standard output.

4. `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`: Get the value of the bit at a specific `index` in the unsigned long int `n`.

5. `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`: Set the bit at a specific `index` to 1 in the unsigned long int `n`.

6. `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`: Set the bit at a specific `index` to 0 in the unsigned long int `n`.

7. `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)`: Calculate the number of bits needed to flip in `n` to transform it into `m`.

8. `int get_endianness(void)`: Check the endianness of the system.

## How to Use:

To use these functions, include the `main.h` header file in your C code, which provides the function prototypes. Then, compile your code with the appropriate source files that implement these functions.
