# Function Pointers in C - README

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the concept of function pointers. Function pointers are pointers that store the address of a function, allowing us to call functions indirectly and pass them as arguments to other functions.

## Description
In the `0x0F-function_pointers` repository, you will find various C programs that showcase the usage of function pointers. Each program demonstrates different scenarios where function pointers are used to achieve flexibility and dynamic behavior in C code.

## Files
The repository includes the following files:
- `function_pointers.h`: A header file containing function prototypes and type definitions related to function pointers.
- `function_pointers.c`: The implementation file where functions using function pointers are defined.
- `main.c`: A sample main program that demonstrates the use of function pointers in different situations.

## Function Pointers
Function pointers are powerful tools in C that allow us to:
- Call functions indirectly through pointers.
- Pass functions as arguments to other functions, providing flexibility and dynamic behavior.
- Implement callback mechanisms.

## How to Use
To compile and run the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x0F-function_pointers.git`
2. Change the current directory to the repository folder: `cd 0x0F-function_pointers`
3. Compile the C files: `gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o my_program function_pointers.c main.c`
4. Run the executable: `./my_program`

## Examples
### Example 1: Function Pointer Basics
The program `main.c` demonstrates the basic usage of function pointers. It defines several functions and uses a function pointer to call these functions indirectly.

### Example 2: Callback Function
In another example, we showcase how function pointers can be used to implement a callback mechanism. The program `callback_example.c` demonstrates this scenario, where a callback function is passed as an argument to another function.
