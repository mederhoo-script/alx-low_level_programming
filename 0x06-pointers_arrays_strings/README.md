## Introduction

In the C programming language, pointers, arrays, and strings are fundamental concepts that every developer should understand. They provide powerful mechanisms for memory manipulation, data storage, and string manipulation. This repository aims to provide practical examples and solutions to help you grasp these concepts effectively.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. Popular options include:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++

Make sure you have a compatible compiler and that it is properly set up on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x05-pointers-arrays-strings.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x05-pointers-arrays-strings
   ```

3. Compile the C files using your preferred compiler. For example, using GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o my_program
   ```

   Adjust the compilation command based on your compiler and preferences.

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./my_program
   ```

   Replace `my_program` with the appropriate executable name if you changed it in the compilation step.

## Tasks

This repository contains the following tasks:

1. **Task 0:** A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to.
2. **Task 1:** A function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **Task 2:** A function that returns the length of a string.
4. **Task 3:** A function that prints a string in reverse.
5. **Task 4:** A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **Task 5:** A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. **Task 6:** A function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
8. **Task 7:** A function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) format.
9. **Task 8:** A function that encodes a string using rot13.

Each task is implemented in a separate C file, named accordingly. Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed.
