# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This repository contains programs written in C that demonstrate the use of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. These fundamental concepts are essential for understanding basic programming logic and control flow in the C programming language.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: This program generates a random number and determines whether it is positive or negative using if-else statements.

- `1-last_digit.c`: This program takes an integer as input and prints its last digit using modulo arithmetic and if-else statements.

- `2-print_alphabet.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.

- `3-print_alphabets.c`: This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using nested while loops.

- `4-print_alphabt.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e' using if-else statements and a while loop.

- `5-print_numbers.c`: This program prints single-digit numbers using a while loop.

- `6-print_numberz.c`: This program prints single-digit numbers using a while loop and the `putchar` function.

- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.

- `8-print_base16.c`: This program prints the numbers from 0 to 9 and the lowercase hexadecimal characters using a while loop.

- `9-print_comb.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using nested while loops and if-else statements.

- `10-print_comb2.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using nested while loops and if-else statements.

## Getting Started

To run these programs on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x01-variables_if_else_while.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while
   ```

3. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output
   ```

4. Run a specific program by executing the generated output file:
   ```
   ./output
   ```
