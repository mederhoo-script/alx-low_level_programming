# 0x02. C - Functions, Nested Loops

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of functions and nested loops. It serves as an introductory exploration of these concepts in the C programming language.

## Description

The programs in this repository focus on the following topics:

1. Functions: Functions are blocks of code that can be called and executed within a C program. They allow for modular and reusable code by encapsulating specific functionality.

2. Nested Loops: Nested loops refer to the concept of having loops within loops. They are useful for iterating over multiple dimensions or performing repetitive tasks that require nested iterations.

## List of Programs

The repository includes the following programs:

1. `1-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet using a function.

2. `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times using nested loops.

3. `3-islower.c`: Checks if a character is lowercase using a function.

4. `4-isalpha.c`: Checks if a character is an alphabetic character using a function.

5. `5-sign.c`: Prints the sign of a number using a function.

6. `6-abs.c`: Computes the absolute value of an integer using a function.

7. `7-print_last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of a number using a function.

8. `8-24_hours.c`: Prints every minute of a day using nested loops.

9. `9-times_table.c`: Prints the times table of 9 using nested loops.

## Getting Started

To compile and run these programs on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files individually.

2. Ensure you have a C compiler installed. These programs are written in standard C and should compile with most C compilers.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run.

4. Compile the program using the C compiler. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <program_name.c> -o <output_file>
    ```

5. Run the compiled program. For example:
    ```bash
    ./<output_file>
    ```

6. Follow the program's prompts or observe the output to see the results.
