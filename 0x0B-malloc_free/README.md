# 0x0B-malloc_free

This repository contains programs written in C as part of the `0x0B-malloc_free` project at Holberton School. The programs demonstrate the usage of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free` functions.

## List of Files

- [0-create_array.c](./0-create_array.c): A function that creates an array of characters.
- [1-strdup.c](./1-strdup.c): A function that duplicates a string using `malloc`.
- [2-str_concat.c](./2-str_concat.c): A function that concatenates two strings into a newly allocated space in memory.
- [3-alloc_grid.c](./3-alloc_grid.c): A function that creates a 2D array of integers.
- [4-free_grid.c](./4-free_grid.c): A function that frees a 2D array of integers created by `alloc_grid` function.
- [100-argstostr.c](./100-argstostr.c): A function that concatenates all the arguments of the program into a single string.
- [101-strtow.c](./101-strtow.c): A function that splits a string into words.
- [holberton.h](./holberton.h): The header file containing function prototypes.

## Usage

To compile the C files, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<output_file>` with the desired name for the output executable.

After compiling, you can run the program using:

```
./<output_file>
```
