## Description

In this project, we explore the fundamentals of File I/O in C programming. This involves reading data from files, writing data to files, and understanding different modes of file access. The tasks within this project are designed to help us grasp the concepts of file manipulation in a C environment.

## Tasks

The tasks covered in this project include:

1. **0-read_textfile.c**: A C function that reads a text file and prints its content to the standard output.

2. **1-create_file.c**: A C function that creates a file if it doesn't exist, or truncates it if it does. It then writes a given text content to the file.

3. **2-append_text_to_file.c**: A C function that appends text to an existing file.

4. **3-cp.c**: A C program that copies the content of one file to another.

## Usage

Each task has its own C source file. You can compile each source file separately to generate the corresponding executable.

To compile a C source file, use a command like:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

You can then execute the generated output file.

## Compilation

To compile all the tasks at once, you can use a build script or manually compile each source file as described above.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any issues or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the C style guidelines and includes appropriate comments.
