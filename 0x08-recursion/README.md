## Introduction

The `0x08-recursion` repository is a collection of C programs that focus on understanding and implementing recursive algorithms. Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

![Recursion Concept](images/recursion_concept.jpg)

The repository includes solutions to problems that can help improve your understanding of recursion and its applications in solving complex tasks. The code is well-commented and designed to be easy to understand, making it a useful resource for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x08-recursion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x08-recursion
   ```

3. Compile the desired program using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## File Descriptions

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string using recursion.

- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

- `3-factorial.c`: Function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

- `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function that calculates the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Function that calculates the square root of a number using recursion.

- `6-is_prime_number.c`: Function that checks if a number is prime using recursion.

- `7-is_palindrome.c`: Function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

- `100-wildcmp.c`: Function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0. The comparison may contain the wildcard character '*'.
